## Projects to build on
- [Hello AI World (jetson-inference)](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference)
    1. Image recognition (imageNet)
    2. Object detection (detectNet)
    3. Segmentation (segNet)

    Library from Nvidia for camera-related detection tasks. CUDA makes it very fast, but sometimes difficult to interface with if you want to get more information than the basic applications.

- [Pose Detection (trt_pose)](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/trt_pose)

    Detect human poses with low latency. Very accurate and seems easy to interface with.

- [Depth Estimation (fast-depth)](https://github.com/dwofk/fast-depth)

- [Gesture Detection (temporal-shift-module)](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/temporal-shift-module)
